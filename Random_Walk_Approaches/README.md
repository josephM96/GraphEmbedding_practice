<h2> Random Walks Approaches </h2>
<h3> Why Random Walk? </h3>
<h4> 1. Expressivity </h4>
<li> Flexible stochastic definition of node similarity that incorporates both local and higher order neighborhood information</li> 
<li></li>
<h4> 2. Efficiency </h4>
<li> Do not need to consider all node pairs when training: only need to consider pairs that co-occur on random walks.</li>
